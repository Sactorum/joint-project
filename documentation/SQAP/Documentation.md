### **4. Documentation**
Documentation must lay the foundation for quality, traceability, and history for both the individual document and for the entire project documentation.
It is also extremely important that the documentation is well arranged, easy to read, and adequate.
#### __4.1 Purpose__
Project documentation is a vital part of project management. It is substantiated by the two essential functions of the documentation: to ensure that the project requirements are fulfilled and to establish traceability with respect to what has been done, who has done it and when it has been done.
#### __4.2 Supplier control__
Projects cannot be implemented without the proper requirements. OutOfBounds team will make the requirements to be measurable, traceable, consistent, complete and acceptable to the stakeholders.
