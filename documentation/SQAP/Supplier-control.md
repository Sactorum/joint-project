### **11. Supplier control**
Suppliers are responsible for the quality of materials and components provided by their sub-tier suppliers and sub-contractors. The OutOfBounds team must impose controls on their sub-tier suppliers that provide quality results and documentation comparable to controls applied to suppliers by Company XX and make the necessary controls on suppliers.  The extent of the controls may vary, depending on the nature and complexity of the product and processes.

For suppliers of critical components, an on-site assessment of the supplier’s facility is performed.  The on-site assessment includes three components:
 
(1) A quality assessment to determine whether the supplier’s quality management system is in place and functioning effectively.  

(2) A business assessment to determine whether the supplier has financial resources, production capacity, and other business resources needed to fulfill our team production needs.

(3) A technology assessment to determine whether the supplier has the needed technical resources, including production and inspection equipment, facilities, engineering resources, etc.
