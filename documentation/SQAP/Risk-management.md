## 14. Risk Managenment

A risk is a uncertain factor whose occurrence may result in loss of satisaction of corresponding objective.
Every risk has a likelihood of occurrence and one o more underirable consequences.
And each risk consequence has a likelihood of occurrence if the risk occurs (not to be confused with risk likelihood) and a severity, the degree of loss of satisfaction of objective.

The risks are classified as:

* Product-related risk: negative impact on functional or non functional objectives of the system.
* Process-related risks: negative impact on development objectives.

### Risk identification

In this case the risks has to be identified through group sessions focused on identification of projects-specific risks. All scenarios in the specification has to be checked to point out failures from "what if" questions:

* Interaction not occurring.
* Interaction occurring too late.
* Unexpected interactions.

### Risk evaluation

Once a risk is identified the possibel consequences should be identified and apply a severity level for a different risk likelihood.

**Qualitative assessment: use Qualitative estimates (levels)**
- For likelihood : likely, possible and unlikely
- For severity: Catastrophyc, severe, high, moderate, low, very low

For each risk a table like the following should be made:


Risk: *Some risk definition*

| Consequence     | Likely     |  Possible  | Unlikely   |
|----------------:|:----------:|-----------:|:----------:|
| *Consequence A* | *severity* | *severity* | *severity* |
| *Consequence B* | *severity* | *severity* | *severity* |
| *Consequence C* | *severity* | *severity* | *severity* |
| *...*           | *...*      |*...*       |  *...*     |


### Risk countermesures

Then, for every risck, countermesures should be proposed. Later on the countermesures has to be explored.
For the reduction of the risks the following tactics are proposed:

* Reduce the risk likelihood (ensure significant decrease).
* Avoid risk (ensure risk may never occur).
* Reduce consequence likelihood (ensure significant decrese of consequence likelihood).
* Avoid risk consequence (ensure consequence may never occur)
* Mitigate risk consequence (reduce severity of consequence)


Finally, a selectes countermesure should be selected.

**Evaluation criteria for preferred countermesure:**
- contribution to critical non-functional requierement
- contribution to resolution of other risks
- cost-effectiveness
