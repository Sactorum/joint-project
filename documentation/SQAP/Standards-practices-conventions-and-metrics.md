## 5. Standards, Practices, Conventions and Metrics

### 5.1 Purpose

The purpose of this section of the SQAP is to identify the processes, product standards, and metrics used by a part 
of the team OutOfBounds, called Quality Assurance Team (QAT).
        
### 5.2 Content

#### 5.2.1 Process Requirements
 
 Documentation, design and coding standards, development and maintenance processes, test standard and practices are all 
 described by the GPT. All these information should be available for the other team members. 
 The QA will take part to monitor the requirements through regularly scheduled, formally documented audits.
 
#### 5.2.2 Identification of the Standards, Practices, Conventions and Metrics:
 
 The content for the developement of this project will be shown below:
 
 * __Standards:__ To make a good distribution of all the standard used in this project, it will be divided in these groups:
 
    * __Documentation standards__: To develop this project, it has been used the _IEEE Standard for Software Quality Assurance                                    Plans_.
    * __Design standards__: There's no standard followed in this part.
    * __Coding standards:__ It has been used a _Standard python guide_ named _PEP8_.
    * __Commentary standards:__ There's no standard followed in this part.
    * __Selected software quality assurance product and processes metrics:__ There's no standard followed in this part.
    
 * __Metrics:__ Actually, the metrics of this project are not defined at all, because it's a part that will be developed as     the project progresses. The metrics that we have defined are:
 
    * The quantity of code that must be tested is between the 70-80%.
  
 * __Guides and Conventions:__ During the development of the project, there has been defined some conventions/basic rules in     order to make clear the way of working of the team project. Also there has been provided some guides for the Development       Team (DT).
