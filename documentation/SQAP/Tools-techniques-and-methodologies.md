### Tools, techniques and methodologies

#### 9.1- Tools:

This section specifies which software and general tools the OutOfBounds team is using to support the Joint Project development.
Fow now, the tools that we are currently utilizing are:

1. **Communication tools**: In this section, we are currently using group calls in Discord and keeping each other informed through a group chat in WhatsApp. we are also using the Google Calendar app to remember yourself about the tasks that need to be done.
2. **Working flow tools**: Here, we are using and have used a shared Drive Folder with shared Google Docs for documentation, a Github Team in which we will have the repositories that will use to make a control over the code, Create.ly for diagrams and Django for the framework in which weâ€™re gonna design our web application. For the meetings, we are using a document template that will have everything that we talk in the meeting written down for future reference.
3. **Requirement gathering tools**: We will use the Volere model to gather the requirements for the project.


#### 9.2- Techniques and Methodologies:

This section will focus on the methods and techniques that we will apply for the development of the Joint Project.

In order to get all the requirements for the development the Web app, we are using a model called **[Volere model](http://www.volere.co.uk)**. This model contains all the steps that the analyst team needs to follow in order to gather information about how everything should work.

**The GitHub Repository** will be used as a tool for both the code and also the formal documentation (the Google Drive will still be used for temporal documentation and also side projects inside the main project). For the purpose of better workflow, we shall use this **[Branching Guidelines](/documentation/procedures/Branching-guidelines.md)**.

To make things easy, there is a **[GitHub Guide](.Git-branch-checkout-guide.md)** in the repository that explains how one can change from branch to branch with a terminal.

Also, in order to do split the work and maintain consistency inside the project, the commits made on to the SQAP-doc and Dev will have an specific name regarding it's changes. For example: the change on SQAP-doc will have "SQAP-#number:".

The **Google Calendar** app will focus mainly on the many tasks assigned to the team. anyone that wants to make a remark over a task can input it in the calendar. There's no need for reviewing the inputs. Reunions, however, are inputted by the Product Manager.

The **[Meeting Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10VLPs66RGmUK8j3YTSl--1COLsmBzrmviAcgNUuulIU/edit)** will be the document used in every meeting of the group, and it will include when do people join the meeting, when they leave, what was needed to be talked in the meeting, what tasks are now needed to be done before the next meeting and how will do the tasks. The person who is tasked to fill this template is the responsible of the department in which the meeting is being made (if the reunion is for the Quality department, the Quality Manager is tasked to do the report).
To know what shall be talked in every meeting, we have a [meeting planning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tBVWKzTT_s8IMxI1Q6lCXuziMxERX9mY6GQump4wtBQ/edit) in which everyone can propose ideas for the next meeting. The points will be referenced in priority order.
