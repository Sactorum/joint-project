### 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Software Quality Assurance Plan (SQAP) is to define the methods, techniques, and procedures that will be used by the OutOfBounds team to assure functional and punctual delivery of the Joint Project software that satisfies all specified requirements. 

The use of this plan assures the following:
   
 * That the software development, evaluation and acceptance standards are developed, followed, and documented.
    
 * That test results adhere to acceptance standards.
