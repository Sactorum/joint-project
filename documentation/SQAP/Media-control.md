### Media control
All documentation generated throughout the course of the project will be
 available at the Google drive folder structure or github repository of 
TeamOutOfBounds.

As the teams are working with GitHub, each member of the team has a full
 copy of the GitHub repository on their personal computers adding redundancy 
 to the system. However, it is under each developer to chose the security
 measures to apply in order to protect the software.
 
The product developed will be deployed directly to Heroku's servers and 
will not be available on a physical device to the customer.
