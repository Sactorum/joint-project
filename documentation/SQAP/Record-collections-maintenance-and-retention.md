# 12. Records Collection, Maintenance and Retention

## 12.1. Quality Assurance Tracking Database

This section is not applicable to our project, so it won't be developed.

## 12.2. Quality Assurance Repository

The QAT will have at its disposal a repository located in the gitHub web page. There 
they will be able to manage all the documentation necessary for the project. 
This repository will contain some branches, one of them named _SQAP-doc_ which is the 
one that the QAT will manage all the information. Once inside the branch, will find 
two folders:
* __SQAP__: here will be added all the documentation necessary for the developement of the 
            QA.
* __guides__: here will contain some necessary information for all the team members.
