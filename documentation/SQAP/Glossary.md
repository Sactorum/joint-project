#### Acronyms and definitions

* **Acceptance testing** : is a test conducted to determine if the requirements\
 of a specification or contract are met. It may involve chemical tests, \
 physical tests, or performance tests. Acceptance testing is also known \
 as user acceptance testing.
 
* **Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)** : is a collaborative approach to\
 software development that bridges the communication gap between business \
 and IT. BDD helps teams communicate requirements with more precision, discover\
 defects early and produce software that remains maintainable over time.
 
 * **Continious Integration (CI)** : methodology that allows to link the\
 requirements to the development and testing. With this methodology  a working\
 version of the product is allways keept.
 
* **Daily Meeting** : informal meeting between 15 - 20 minutes where developers\
expose the problems they encounter.

* **Deploy check** : Automated process that pushes the code to the live server.

* **Development Team (DT)** : this team is formed by two members and will only  
be involved in code related activities.

* **General Purpose Team (GPT)** : team which members can be assigned into a\
large variety of product related activities such as design, development,\
test or quality assurance procedures.

* **Integration test** : is the phase in software testing in which individual\
 software modules are combined and tested as a group.

* **Quality Assurance Team (QAT)** : team composed by two members who are only  
involved in QA activities.

* **Regression tests** : is re-running functional and non-functional tests to\
 ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs after a\
 change. Changes that may require regression testing include bug fixes,\
 software enhancements, configuration changes, and even substitution of\
 electronic components.
 
 * **Release review** : meeting held between the Product Owner and the\ 
 Quality Assurance Manager where they merge development branch and SQAP-doc branch and\ 
 review the changes being applied.
 
* **Release integration** : Process where all code is tested automatically\
using CI tools.

* **Requirement licitation** : Phase where the requirement analysts discover\
the requirements of the project.
 
* **Sprint Planning** : Meeting where the DT and GPT distribute the tasks to\
develop during the Sprint and assign a Product Owner.
 
* **Sprint Retrospective** : Meeting where the DT and GPT discuss how the\
Sprint was conducted and search for points of improvement.
  
* **Sprint Review** : Meeting held between the Stakeholders involved in the project and\
the DT and GPT where the software produced during the Sprint is shown.

* **System test**: System testing is testing conducted on a complete integrated\
 system to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified requirements.
 
* **Test-driven development (TDD)** : is an evolutionary approach to development\
 which combines test-first development where you write a test before you\
 write just enough production code to fulfill that test and refactoring.

* **Unit test** : is a software testing method by which individual units \
of source code.

* **Writing User Stories** : Process where the requirement analysts write\
the BUC's, PUC's and User Stories to properly communticate with the development\
team and the general purpose team assigned to development activities.
