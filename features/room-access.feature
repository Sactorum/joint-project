  In order to be able to access the data of a room
  As an user
  I want to make sure everything is loaded correctly and without mistakes

  Scenario: I access a room where everything is correct
    Given Exists a user "username" with password "password"
    And Exists a room named "room_name"
      | temp    | hum      | quantity   | limit    | room_status  |
      | 10      | 30       | 10         | 50       | 0            |
    And There is a container "container" assigned to that room
      | product_id | producer_id | limit | temp_min | temp_max  | hum_min  | hum_max | room      |
